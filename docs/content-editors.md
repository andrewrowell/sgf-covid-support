## Team Structure

### Project Lead

[Kate Hanson](https://github.com/KM-Hanson) is the project lead and was the person who first came up with the idea to build this site.

> *TODO: Add more team members here*

### Business Owners

If you are a business owner and you would like to add or update your business, just click on our little "Add your business" button at the top right of the site. You will see a dialog pop up which gives you a choice of two forms, one for adding a new business and the second is for you to send us updates for an existing business.

Once you have submitted your form, our content team will do the rest :)

### Content Ambassadors

Are you able to spare some time to become a volunteer Content Ambassador? We are looking for people to join our enthusiastic team of ambassadors so that we are able to add more businesses and continue to keep the existing businesses up to date.

If you are interested in becoming a content Ambassador, please drop us an email to [contact@nccovidsupport.org](mailto:contact@nccovidsupport.org) and one of us will get back to you with more details.
